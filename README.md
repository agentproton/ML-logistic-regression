# ML-logistic-regression
we designing a Predictor using logistic regression  with two basic features which are given
using Batch Gradient Descent Algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Algorithm
and mini batch Gradient Descent algorithms (determining minibatch size is
your choice- here it could be 10, 20, 30 etc.) with and without feature
scalingâ€‹ and compare their performances in terms of % error in
prediction.(only allowed to use NumPy library of Python, no other
functions/libraries are allowed).
